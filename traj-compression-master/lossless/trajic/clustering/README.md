This directory contains the code used to cluster the
[Illinois trajectory data](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~boxu/mp2p/gps_data.html)
for the experiments in our paper. It is intended to be run with
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

Please note that this code was not originally designed to be released, so
it contains things like hard-coded file paths. We are making the code available
in the hopes that it will have some use as a reference point.
